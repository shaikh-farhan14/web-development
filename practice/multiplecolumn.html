      Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object
      known to harbor life.[23] This is enabled by Earth being an ocean world,
      the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost
      all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of
      Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which
      is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land
      hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is at least somewhat humid and covered by
      vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more
      water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers, and atmospheric water
      combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which
      interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has
      a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting
      most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation. Earth has a
      dynamic atmosphere, which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects
      it from most meteoroids and UV-light at entry. It has a composition of
      primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Water vapor is widely present in the
      atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of the planet. The water vapor
      acts as a greenhouse gas and, together with other greenhouse gases in the
      atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), creates the conditions for
      both liquid surface water and water vapor to persist via the capturing of
      energy from the Sun's light. This process maintains the current average
      surface temperature of 14.76 °C (58.57 °F), at which water is liquid under
      normal atmospheric pressure. Differences in the amount of captured energy
      between geographic regions (as with the equatorial region receiving more
      sunlight than the polar regions) drive atmospheric and ocean currents,
      producing a global climate system with different climate regions, and a
      range of weather phenomena such as precipitation, allowing components such
      as nitrogen to cycle.
